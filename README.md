## What is this?
StudyHour is a web application built to help you find the ideal study location. Our app is tailored to your study needs. Do you find yourself
wondering if a location has wifi or outlets? Perhaps you like a quiet location or maybe your like the chatter. StudyHour implements a review based system which
allows you to search for study locations near you. Think Yelp, geared towards the study location seeker! You can build out a profile and track your favorite locations.
Upload photos of locations and leave comments and information about outlets, wifi, and noise level. Together we will find the best Study Locations!
